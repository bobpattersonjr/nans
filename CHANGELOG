[2001-11-27]
 * NANS 0.6 released.

[2001-11-14]
 * (Finally) incorporated the enhancements sent to me by Alan Ritari.
   Testing is going on, and I will release a new version soon.  This 
   gives you the ability to send notifications by group.  Woooooo.

[2001-07-18]
 * NANS 0.5 released.

[2001-07-16]
 * Done with 0.5.  Running it at work for a few days to make sure 
   there aren't any odd issues, then I'll release it here in a 
   few days (the coming weekend at the latest).

[2001-07-13]
 * Happy Friday the 13th.  Added improved error checking and logging 
   to the upcoming v0.5.  Good stuff.  Should help those who had
   problems getting it up and running.  Release any day now.
 * Realized I never changed the header of the CHANGELOG to say 
   "NANS" instead of "utilities".  D'oh.  Fixed.

[2001-07-12]
 * Fixed bug in the notification count logic.  Will be included in 
   0.5, along with other fixes/improvements - like improved error 
   checking.

[2001-07-09]
 * Update the VERSION in aggregate-notify-0.4.1.pl to match the 
   filename (now reads 0.4.1 as it should).  Oops.

[2001-07-01]
 * Fixed minor bug in aggregate-notify.pl - was puking with errors on 
   some OS's.  Should work fine on them now.  Incremented version on 
   aggregate-notify to 0.4.1.

[2001-06-18]
 * Fixed minor typo in one error message in aggregate-notify.pl

[2001-06-14]
 * NANS 0.4 released.
   - code cleanup
   - new report: mini-summary
   - added "|||" as divider to make pages easier to read
   - fixed inline docs to be more accurate

[2001-05-23]
 * Initial release of NANS - the Netsaint Aggregate Notification 
   System.
